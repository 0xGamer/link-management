# Link Management System
A simple Link Management API written using javascript.

## Structure
- Stack: Backend: Nodejs and expressjs, Front End: Reactjs with vite
- Testing: jest and supertest
- Database: MongoDB (Atlas)
- Other tools:
	- `nodemon` for dev server
	- `morgan` for logging
	- `helmet` to set security headers
	- `dotenv` to manage environment variables
	- `cors` to set cross site headers
	- `prettier` to format code

The client resides in the `/client` folder


## How to setup
